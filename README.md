## 📌 Project Overview

Medical documents such as lab reports, discharge summaries, or research papers often contain complex terminology and lengthy descriptions, making them hard to understand for non-experts. This project introduces **Medical Query Bot**, a user-friendly system that simplifies and summarizes such documents and enables interactive Q&A using natural language.

The system allows users to:
- Upload medical PDFs  
- Receive simplified, context-aware summaries  
- Ask questions in natural language and get relevant answers  
- Maintain privacy by running completely offline (local system)
